# Pin to a concrete release rather than `latest`, which lags. The suite needs
# 0.8 or newer: batch evaluations and Search arrived in 0.3, capability URNs in
# the metadata document in 0.4, decision context in 0.5, the Obligations
# Profile in 0.6, the Access Request and Approval discovery members in 0.7, and
# the singular response to a batch without evaluations and case-insensitive
# Content-Type matching in 0.8 — all of which the tests assert.
